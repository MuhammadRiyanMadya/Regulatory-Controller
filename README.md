# Regulatory Controller

This repository is a collection of process control source codes with the *first principle* application. Some of the most important codes are
System Identification where finding conventional FOPTD parameters being optimized resulting a highly accurate control parameters, Cascade
Controller where such a complex system being simulated, including time delay domination simulation, and Conventionsl PID to give a clear understanding
of how the most conventinal controller works.
